## [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* Declarative - React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
* Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

## [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/)

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).

## [Redux-Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)

`redux-saga` is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, simple to test, and better at handling failures.
It uses an ES6 feature called Generators to make those asynchronous flows easy to read, write and test.

## [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/)

Next.js is a minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications. It provides code-splitting and therefore lazy-loading out of the box. It internally takes care of a lot of boilerplate including state transfer and developing react components without the need to take care of rendering environment.

## [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)

Reselect is a ‚Äúselector‚Äù library for Redux. Reselect helps build memoized selectors which are functions that retrieve snippets of the Redux state for our React components. Using memoization, we prevent unnecessary re-renders and re-calculations of derived data, which in turn speeds up our application.

* Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
* Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments change.
* Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.

## [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)

`style-components` is a CSS-in-JS library that removes the mapping between components and styles by allowing us to define our styles within the component itself by utilizing tagged template literals. Thus making components the fundamental way to build a styled UI.

## [Immutable.js](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/)

Immutable data cannot be changed once created, leading to much simpler application development, no defensive copying, and enabling advanced memoization and change detection techniques with simple logic. Persistent data presents a mutative API which does not update the data in-place, but instead always yields new updated data.

Immutable.js provides many Persistent Immutable data structures including: List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record.

These data structures are highly efficient on modern JavaScript VMs by using structural sharing via hash maps tries and vector tries as popularized by Clojure and Scala, minimizing the need to copy or cache data.

Immutable.js also provides a lazy Seq, allowing efficient chaining of collection methods like map and filter without creating intermediate representations. Create some Seq with Range and Repeat.

## [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr)

Many APIs, public or not, return JSON data that has deeply nested objects. Using data in this kind of structure is often very difficult for JavaScript applications, especially those using Flux or Redux.

Normalizr is a small, but powerful utility for taking JSON with a schema definition and returning nested entities with their IDs, gathered in dictionaries.
